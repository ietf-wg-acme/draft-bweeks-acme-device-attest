1.  Introduction

   The Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) [RFC8555]
   standard specifies methods for validating control over identifiers,
   such as domain names.  It is also useful to be able to validate
   properties of the device requesting the certificate, such as the
   identity of the device /and whether the certificate key is protected
   by a secure cryptoprocessor.

   Many operating systems and device vendors offer functionality
   enabling a device to generate a cryptographic attestation of their
   identity, such as:

   *  Android Key Attestation
      (https://source.android.com/security/keystore/attestation)

   *  Chrome OS Verified Access (https://developers.google.com/chrome/
      verified-access/overview)

   *  Trusted Platform Module
      (https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/resource/trusted-platform-
      module-tpm-summary/)

   *  Managed Device Attestation for Apple Devices
      (https://support.apple.com/en-om/guide/deployment/dep28afbde6a/
      web)

   Using ACME and device attestation to issue client certificates for
   enterprise PKI is anticipated to be the most common use case.  The
   following variances to the ACME specification are described in this
   document:

   *  Addition of permanent-identifier [RFC4043] and hardware-module
      [RFC4108] identifier types.

   *  Addition of the device-attest-01 challenge type to prove control
      of the permanent-identifier and hardware-module identifier types.

   *  The challenge response payload contains a serialized WebAuthn
      attestation statement format instead of an empty JSON object ({}).

   *  Accounts and external account binding being used as a mechanism to
      pre-authenticate requests to an enterprise CA.

   This document does not specify the attestation verification
   procedures.  Section 13 of [WebAuthn] gives some guidance, however
   verification procedures are complex and may require changes to
   address future security issues.

   Efforts are underway within the Remote ATtestation ProcedureS (RATS)
   working group to define a set of standard formats and protocols for
   attestation.  An explict aim of this document is to support vendor
   specific formats and protocols that are widley deployed at the time
   it was authored.  In the future, an ACME challenge type based on
   these standards SHOULD be used instead of device-attest-01.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Permanent Identifier

   A new identifier type, "permanent-identifier" is introduced to
   represent the identity of a device assigned by the manufacturer,
   typically a serial number.  The name of this identifier type was
   chosen to align with [RFC4043], it does not prescribe the lifetime of
   the identifier, which is at the discretion of the Assigner Authority.

   The identity along with the assigning organization can be included in
   the Subject Alternate Name Extension using the PermanentIdentifier
   form described in [RFC4043].

   Clients MAY include this identifier in the certificate signing
   request (CSR).  Alternatively if the server wishes to only issue
   privacy-preserving certificates, it MAY reject CSRs containing a
   PermanentIdentifier in the subjectAltName extension.

4.  Hardware Module

   A new identifier type, "hardware-module" is introduced to represent
   the identity of the secure cryptoprocessor that generated the
   certificate key.

   The hardware module identity can be included in the Subject Alternate
   Name Extension using the HardwareModuleName form described in
   [RFC4108].  The HardwareModuleName is encoded as an otherName with
   the OID id-on-hardwareModuleName (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.8.4) and consists of:

   *  hwType: An OBJECT IDENTIFIER that identifies the type of hardware
      module

   *  hwSerialNum: An OCTET STRING containing the hardware module serial
      number

   Clients MAY include this identifier in the certificate signing
   request (CSR).  When included in a CSR, it MUST appear in an
   extensionRequest attribute [RFC2985] requesting a subjectAltName
   extension.

   If the server includes HardwareModule in the subjectAltName extension
   the CA MUST verify that the certificate key was generated on the
   secure cryptoprocessor with the asserted identity and type.  The key
   MUST NOT be able to be exported from the cryptoprocessor.

   If the server wishes to issue privacy-preserving certificates, it MAY
   omit HardwareModule from the subjectAltName extension.

5.  Device Attestation Challenge

   The client can prove control over a permanent identifier of a device
   by providing an attestation statement containing the identifier of
   the device.

   The device-attest-01 ACME challenge object has the following format:

   type (required, string):  The string "device-attest-01".

   token (required, string):  A random value that uniquely identifies
      the challenge.  This value MUST have at least 128 bits of entropy.
      It MUST NOT contain any characters outside the base64url alphabet,
      including padding characters ("=").  See [RFC4086] for additional
      information on randomness requirements.

   {
     "type": "device-attest-01",
     "url": "https://example.com/acme/chall/Rg5dV14Gh1Q",
     "status": "pending",
     "token": "evaGxfADs6pSRb2LAv9IZf17Dt3juxGJ-PCt92wr-oA"
   }

   A client fulfills this challenge by constructing a key authorization
   (Section 8.1 of [RFC8555]) from the "token" value provided in the
   challenge and the client's account key.  The client then generates a
   WebAuthn attestation object using the key authorization as the
   challenge.

   This specification borrows the WebAuthn _attestation object_
   representation as described in Section 6.5.4 of [WebAuthn] for
   encapsulating attestation formats, but with these modifications:

   *  The key authorization is used to form _attToBeSigned_. This
      replaces the concatenation of _authenticatorData_ and
      _clientDataHash_. _attToBeSigned_ is hashed using an algorithm
      specified by the attestation format.

   *  The _authData_ field is unused and SHOULD be omitted.

   A client responds with the response object containing the WebAuthn
   attestation object in the "attObj" field to acknowledge that the
   challenge can be validated by the server.

   On receiving a response, the server constructs and stores the key
   authorization from the challenge's "token" value and the current
   client account key.

   To validate a device attestation challenge, the server performs the
   following steps:

   1.  Perform the verification procedures described in Section 6 of
       [WebAuthn].

   2.  Verify that key authorization conveyed by _attToBeSigned_ matches
       the key authorization stored by the server.

   POST /acme/chall/Rg5dV14Gh1Q
   Host: example.com
   Content-Type: application/jose+json

   {
     "protected": base64url({
       "alg": "ES256",
       "kid": "https://example.com/acme/acct/evOfKhNU60wg",
       "nonce": "SS2sSl1PtspvFZ08kNtzKd",
       "url": "https://example.com/acme/chall/Rg5dV14Gh1Q"
     }),
     "payload": base64url({
       "attObj": base64url(/* WebAuthn attestation object */),
     }),
     "signature": "Q1bURgJoEslbD1c5...3pYdSMLio57mQNN4"
   }

   The webauthn payload MAY contain any identifiers registered in
   "WebAuthn Attestation Statement Format Identifiers" and any
   extensions registered in "WebAuthn Extension Identifiers"
   [IANA-Webauthn], [RFC8809].

6.  Security Considerations

   See Section 13 of [WebAuthn] for additional security considerations
   related to attestation statement formats, including certificate
   revocation.

   Key attestation statements may include a variety of information in
   addition to the public key being attested.  While not described in
   this document, the server MAY use any policy when evaluating this
   information.  This evaluation can result in rejection of a
   certificate request that features a verifiable key attestation for
   the public key contained in the request.  For example, an attestation
   statement may indicate use of an unacceptable firmware version.

Appendix A.  Enterprise PKI

   ACME was originally envisioned for issuing certificates in the Web
   PKI, however this extension will primarily be useful in enterprise
   PKI.  The subsection below covers some operational considerations for
   an ACME-based enterprise CA.

A.1.  External Account Binding

   An enterprise CA likely only wants to receive requests from
   authorized devices.  It is RECOMMENDED that the server require a
   value for the "externalAccountBinding" field to be present in
   "newAccount" requests.

   If an enterprise CA desires to limit the number of certificates that
   can be requested with a given account, including limiting an account
   to a single certificate.  After the desired number of certificates
   have been issued to an account, the server MAY revoke the account as
   described in Section 7.1.2 of [RFC8555].
