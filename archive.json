          "body": "@arianvp from a discussion with @brandonweeks I concluded that the \"Attestation CA\" part is intentionally omitted from the RFC, because it would be very dependent on the (TPM/TEE) platform and thus hard to sufficiently specify in a standard. It is expected that a device in need of a DA proof for ACME DA interacts with another system, the \"Attestation CA\", also sometimes called \"Privacy CA\" or \"Anonymization CA\"; and perhaps other names, before interacting with an ACME server. How and when a device does this, is essentially up to the parties involved in manufacturing and using the device. \r\n\r\nFor iOS, the servers are provided by Apple and attestation involves checking against the manufacturing records they have for the device before a device is issued a certificate. In https://github.com/smallstep/certificates/ we also support ACME DA with Yubikeys, which can create an attestation certificate themselves using the embedded intermediate CA every Yubikey has. Other platforms could implement something similar to the Yubikey or Apple, depending on security requirements, and probably already do so. I'm not aware of a fully specified, standardized protocol to perform this step, but the example at https://github.com/google/go-attestation#example-device-identity and the description at https://tpm2-software.github.io/tpm2-tss/getting-started/2019/12/18/Remote-Attestation.html offer some guidance on what such a protocol would look like. A notable open source project that includes device attestation is https://keylime.dev/, but it goes further than just device identity attestation: it also does measured boot verification and runtime integrity attestation.\r\n\r\nI've described my own adaptation of the attestation flow (and ACME DA) in a blog at https://smallstep.com/blog/managed-device-attestation/#trusted-platform-module-tpm-attestation and have a POC for the attestation CA that we maybe are going to expand on, but hasn't been planned nor fully thought-out yet.",

That CSR must be signed by a private key created in the TPM. The ACME server then has to verify the properties of the attestation object accordingly.\r\n\r\nIn the example client a `PermanentIdentifier` is used, but that can also be a `HardwareModuleName` (the value of which first has to be read from the TPM). In https://github.com/brandonweeks/acme-device-attest-demo/blob/main/client/client.go#L281-L295 a new private key is created inside the TPM that is attested by the AK. The resulting private key has a reference to its certification parameters that are included in the attestation statement that is sent to the ACME server: https://github.com/brandonweeks/acme-device-attest-demo/blob/160b88dfb210a0f074232514eaf31d57975be715/client/client.go#L118-L131. That part is in the `CreateAttestation` property, which is a `TPMB_Attest` structure in TPM parlance (I believe; the Go pkg doc states it's `TPMS_Attest`). The CA can read this property and verify the key resides in the TPM.\r\n\r\nI'm not entirely sure yet if this is how it's supposed to work and if we're going to implement it like this in `step-ca`. I think the main ideas are in the right direction, though.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Is it an `otherName` w/ a specific OID like `PermanentIdentifier`?\n\n[RFC 8555 \u00a77.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8555#section-7.4) says:\n\n> The CSR MUST indicate the exact same set of requested identifiers as the initial newOrder request. Identifiers of type \"dns\" MUST appear either in the commonName portion of the requested subject name or in an extensionRequest attribute [[RFC2985](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2985)] requesting a subjectAltName extension, or both. (These identifiers may appear in any sort order.)  Specifications that define new identifier types must specify where in the certificate signing request these identifiers can appear.\n\nFor an ACME server to meet that requirement I think the specification of the `hardware-module` identifier needs to provide more detail.

Presently the draft defers to [RFC 4043](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4043) for the form the `permanent-identifier` should take inside of a CSR's `subjectAltName` extension.\n\nHowever, in RFC 8555 when [applying for cert issuance](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8555#section-7.4) the new order request identifier values are strings. It's not immediately obvious to me how one would encode a `PermanentIdentifier` from RFC 4043 in that context. Would it be just the `identifierValue UTF8String OPTIONAL` field?\n\nSimilarly, when it comes time for the ACME server to match up the CSR contents with the order identifiers, is there more specific advice to offer? In particular both fields of the `PermanentIdentifier` are spec'd as OPTIONAL and 4043 has a lot of text describing how to interpret the omission/inclusion of each. How will that map to the identifier types when matching CSR/order contents?\n\nI'm not very familiar with the problem space this draft is tackling so I might be confusing myself here :-) I came up with these questions while trying to review parts of an implementation proposed for the [instant-acme](https://github.com/djc/instant-acme) client.",

One of its stated goals is to \"Provide a test-bed for new and compatibility breaking ACME features\" so hopefully there would be mutual interest. \n\nHowever, even if the LE folks weren't interested in support (perhaps it would require some heavyweight dependencies or significant amounts of new code) I think having a fork of Pebble with support would be more appealing for prospective client developers than `step-ca`. \n\nStep is great, but it's fairly heavy-weight in comparison to Pebble.

I think this is a change in the right direction.\r\n\r\nDid you want to look at the question of how servers should be matching CSR subjectAltName extensionRequest attributes with ACME order identifiers separately or was that part of my issue not well articulated? I think there's still room to make that aspect of the draft a bit tighter even after this update.",

The things that stick out to me in this one vs the other are the mention of the otherName OID, and the extra clarity on the expected RFC 2985 CSR attribute.\r\n\r\nI think the extra detail here is good, so probably backporting some of it to the preceding section might be the best way to go.
